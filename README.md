# OneTodoApp

My goal with this project is to make a basic todo app and see how many times I can rewrite it in different stacks/languages to expand my knowledge on different technologies.


## Stacks/Technologies I'd like to write this in
- NextJs
- NuxtJs
- ReactNative
- .NET Blazor Server
- .NET Blazor Wasm
- Something with Python?


This project will be organized in sub-projects from the root. Each folder is a different stack. I am not sure how far I will get with this, but I have an itch to try new frameworks and languages.

# Application Requirements

- Need a way to make a user account (most TS apps will likely use better auth)
- A user can have 0 or many lists
- Each list can have an ordered list of items in it.
  - Each item can be completed or not completed using a checkbox.
  - Completed items get moved to a "grayed out" view at the bottom of the list.
  - Users can sort the list by name, or datetime added in asc and dsc order.
  - The name of each list can be edited.
  - Each list can be deleted (soft delete).
